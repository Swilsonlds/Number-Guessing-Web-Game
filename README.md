# Overview

The purpose of this exercise was to brush up on my basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. What I've created is an extremely simple number guessing game that can be run in the browser.

# Web Pages

The site consists only of one page. The majority of the elements are statically popoulated, however, the "High Score" tracker, and the "Number of guesses" upon successfully guessing are dynamically populated.

# Development Environment

This site was created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# Useful Websites

* [W3Schools Javascript]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp))


# Future Work

At the moment, I do not plan on making any modifications to this project.
